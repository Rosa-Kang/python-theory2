# Database Design
# Never put the same string of data more than once.**
# What is the best practice for how many times a piece of string data should be stored in a database? 1
# What is a foreign key?
# A number that points to the primary key of an associated row in a different table.
# Three Kinds of Keys.
# 1. Primary key - generally an integer auto-increment field
# 2. Logical key - what the outside world uses for lookup
# 3. Foreign key - generally an integer key pointing to a row in another table.


# What does the INSERT command do in SQL?
# It defines a new row by listing the fields we want to include followed by the values we want to placed in the new row.
